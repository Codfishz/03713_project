# HomologousProteinSeeker tool (03713_final_project)
The pipeline is for taking in amino acid sequences and using a combination of bioinformatic tools in order to compare homologous protein structures visually and annotatively as the goal. Esm-fold is a way for us to get structure predictions of the amino acid sequences from Fasta files to Pdb files. Through this pipeline you can take and compare multiple predicted structures through Pymol and search for similar proteins in various protein databases via Foldseek. A python script is made for each fasta file and output to a sbatch script which then would be submitted to GPU-shared clusters in Bridges to run Esm-fold. Once the predictions are given as pdb files, Pymol can visualize and compare the structures and get RMSD values as txt files and png(s) of the structures. Foldseek is also used on the pdb files to search databases to get similar proteins and do structural annotation to understand structure conservation, understand functional domains, and for distant homology detection.
